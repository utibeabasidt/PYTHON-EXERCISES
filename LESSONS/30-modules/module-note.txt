A module is a file containing codes that you can resuse in another code file. You must avoid hypens in naming your module file

You can import:
  variables
  functions
  operations, etc

module-1.py is the parent file, while module-2.py is the child file
If there is a variable or groups of variables that would be used in more than 2 files, it is best to create them in a seperate file to avoid conflicts
